## 1. List of Skills/Techniques through the project
| Skill/Technique                     | Description |
|-------------------------------------|-------------|
| Data Manipulation and Cleaning      | Utilized pandas for data cleaning, preparation, and manipulation, ensuring high-quality inputs for analysis. |
| Multiple Linear Regression Modeling | Employed sklearn and statsmodels to fit and interpret multiple linear regression models, emphasizing the understanding of relationships between variables. |
| Statistical Testing and Analysis    | Conducted hypothesis testing, including t-tests and F-tests, to assess the significance of model coefficients and overall model fit without relying on built-in functions. |
| Variance Estimation                 | Calculated variance and standard errors manually to estimate the precision of regression coefficients, showcasing a deep grasp of statistical foundations. |
| Confidence and Prediction Intervals | Derived confidence and prediction intervals for regression coefficients and model predictions, illustrating an ability to quantify uncertainty in estimates. |
| Residual Analysis                   | Analyzed residuals to evaluate model assumptions and identify potential model improvements, highlighting critical thinking in model evaluation. |
| Data Visualization                  | Created plots using matplotlib to visualize regression fits, residuals, and confidence/prediction intervals, facilitating an intuitive understanding of model performance. |
