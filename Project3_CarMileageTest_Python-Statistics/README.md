## 1. Overview
In this project, a multiple linear regression analysis is conducted on a car mileage dataset to estimate gasoline mileage using Python. The analysis focuses on the relationship between gasoline mileage (mpg) and several independent variables including engine displacement (cid), horsepower (rhp), vehicle weight (etw), compression ratio (cmp), axle ratio (axle), and the power-to-weight ratio (n/v). After fitting the model, the summary statistics reveal insights into the contribution of each variable to gasoline mileage.

Key tasks include fitting a multiple linear regression model, estimating variance and standard errors of regression coefficients manually, testing the significance of the regression model, conducting t-tests for each independent variable, finding confidence intervals on regression coefficients, and plotting residuals to assess model fit. The analysis identifies significant variables impacting gasoline mileage, providing a statistical foundation for predicting vehicle efficiency.
