## 1. Overview
In this Python project, I explore a bike-sharing dataset to predict demand, focusing on data quality and uncovering usage patterns. Key steps include datetime adjustments for time series analysis, outlier handling, and decomposing data to identify trends and seasonality. The process distinguishes between user types for nuanced insights. Through statistical tests and visualizations, I confirm seasonality and select relevant features based on correlation analysis, optimizing the dataset for forecasting models. This approach combines data cleaning, temporal analysis, and visualization to prepare for demand prediction.
